# startWarsAPI 

## Description

This project is a frontend&backend application built using Node.js and React.js, 
meant to show the retrievement of api data from the star wars api and and view it in a simple React.js single page application.

Each folder has it's own README.md file that explains its details includeing usage and dependencies.

##### Please pay attention - the Frontend project has a variable named MAX_PAGE_SIZE which is set to 10, since the star wars api has a very few selected movies - in the current setting it will always show all the movies in the first page. if you'd like to see the implemented pagination - change the 'MAX_PAGE_SIZE' value to be a lower number, like 2.

### **May the Force be with you!**
